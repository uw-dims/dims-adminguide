====================================
DIMS Administrator Guide v |release|
====================================

This document (version |release|) covers issues related to system
administration of DIMS components from an administrator's perspective.

.. warning::

   This is a `living document` that is being updated frequently to reflect
   current practices within the DIMS team.  As such, it may undergo
   restructuring frequently and the most up-to-date information will be found
   at https://u12-dev-svr-1.prisem.washington.edu:8080/docs/

   Throughout this document, ``warning::``, ``note::``, or other
   callout directives are used to let you know when to read carefully
   and be aware of things that might not be exactly up-to-date or
   safe for blind *cut+paste* into command lines.
